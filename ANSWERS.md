- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
    Class components enhances functional components with setState and lifecycle hooks with High-Order Components.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
    1. render() - Handles the rendering of your component to the UI.
    2. componentDidMount() - Allows the use of setState() without the user seeing any UI updates with the double rendering.
    3. componentDidUpdate() - Updates the DOM in response to prop or state changes.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
    Custom hooks let you extract component logic into reusable functions.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
    Testing determines whether the app can be successfully downloaded, executed and interacted with the supporting back-end content infrastructure.
